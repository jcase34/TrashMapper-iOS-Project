# TrashMapper-iOS-Project

## Motivation 

This is a personal project I've decided to work on to help build out my iOS development/Swift skillset and hopefully help clean up the environment.


## Description

TrashMapper will be an iOS app available on mobile devices. It will utilize crowd-sourced data to identify locations of waste in neighborhoods, parks, beaches, etc.

Users of the app will be able to create and account or login through the application via email. Once logged in, they will be able to submit a post containing a picture and relevant details of garbage they've seen within their proximity.

The post will be stored on device and uploaded to Firebase and distributed to other users. As other users login to the application, tagged locations will be pulled from Firebase and visible on their device. 

## Features 

The app will utilize the Apple MapKit for it's main view and map view. Tagged locations will be shown on the map as pins and will provide basic information about a user post.

There will also be a tableView which will contain a list of the posts, similar to the tagged locations but in tableView form. Similar post information wil lbe available.

The app will use Firebase as it's backend service. CRUD operations will need to be supported as the data points will contiuously change within the application.
